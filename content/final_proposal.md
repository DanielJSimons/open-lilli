# BP

## I.  Objectives

BP's transition strategy is under intense scrutiny from investors, regulators, NGOs, and the communities where it operates. The objectives of this assessment are clear and evidence-led:

- Map stakeholder objectives and measure awareness of BP's low-carbon strategy, including perceptions of recent changes to its 2030 oil and gas production targets and the removal of the 50 GW renewables goal.

- Assess the influence BP holds with institutional investors, regulators, NGOs, and local communities, and identify which channels-traditional or social media-shape these perceptions most strongly.

- Benchmark BP's brand association in renewables and low-carbon solutions against key peers, using quantitative data and network analysis, to clarify how recent actions (such as the acquisition of Lightsource BP and the JERA joint venture) affect credibility.

- Identify the most effective media and partner channels for communicating BP's evolving strategy, with a focus on high-impact investments in renewables, hydrogen, EV charging, and operational emissions reductions.

- Pinpoint other organizations and figures shaping the clean energy narrative among BP's stakeholders, and analyze their influence on BP's reputation.

- Develop a framework to benchmark BP's reach and resonance in clean energy, enabling ongoing tracking of progress and stakeholder sentiment over time.

This approach will provide BP with a candid, data-driven view of its current standing and inform targeted engagement to strengthen its credibility in the energy transition.

## II.  Recommended Approach

Our approach begins with a thorough onboarding process. This step allows us to understand BP's recent strategic shifts, stakeholder relationships, and prior engagement efforts. We aim to build on existing insights and identify actionable opportunities for strengthening BP's credibility and influence in the energy transition.

Given the complexity of BP's stakeholder environment-ranging from ESG-focused investors to local communities and NGOs-a mixed-methods research design is essential. We will combine media analytics, elite qualitative research, and peer benchmarking to map perceptions, identify gaps, and recommend targeted actions.

We recommend the following phased approach:

  - Phase One: Hypothesis Generation
    
      - Review BP's current transition targets, recent changes to climate commitments, and stakeholder expectations.
      - Formulate working hypotheses on credibility gaps and engagement opportunities.

  - Phase Two: Traditional and Social Media Analysis
    
      - Analyze coverage and sentiment across key media outlets and social channels, focusing on BP's renewables narrative and comparison with peers.
      - Identify influential voices-including NGOs, investors, and social media figures-shaping BP's public profile.

  - Phase Three: Elite Qualitative Research
    
      - Conduct in-depth interviews and focus groups with senior stakeholders across regions.
      - Capture qualitative insights on BP's reputation, perceived strengths, and areas for improvement.

  - Phase Four: Analysis
    
      - Synthesize quantitative and qualitative findings to benchmark BP's brand association in clean energy.
      - Highlight case studies, such as the Peacock Solar Farm, to illustrate community and environmental benefits.

  - Phase Five: Reporting and Next Steps
    
      - Deliver clear, evidence-based recommendations. These will include:
        
          - Reaffirming credible transition targets and publishing an annual, third-party verified Renewables Progress Report.
          - Enhancing ESG investor engagement and transparency.
          - Launching media campaigns that feature success stories and shared community benefits.
          - Early engagement with NGOs and local communities-potentially through a BP Climate Advisory Council and pilot community investment programs.
          - Leveraging social media influencers and partner channels to amplify BP's progress and commitments.

Our process is designed to provide BP with a candid, data-driven assessment and a practical roadmap for strengthening stakeholder trust and advancing its low-carbon strategy.

### Phase One: Hypothesis Generation

We will begin with a hypothesis generation phase to ground the research in BP's current realities and stakeholder landscape. This phase starts with a thorough review of all relevant internal and external research, focusing on perceptions of BP's energy transition, brand credibility in renewables, and the motivations of key stakeholders-including investors, regulators, NGOs, and affected communities.

Recent strategic changes at BP shape the context for this review. The company has scaled back its 2030 oil and gas production cut target from 40% to 25%, and the new CEO has signaled greater flexibility on renewables, scrapping the 50 GW renewables target by early 2025. In 2023, BP spent $1.3 billion on its low-carbon business versus $15 billion on oil and gas projects. This means that for every $1 invested in clean energy, more than $11 went to fossil fuels. These facts will inform our initial hypotheses about stakeholder perceptions and the credibility of BP's transition narrative.

Investor pressures are divided. ESG-focused investors are calling for stronger climate action and credible decarbonization pathways. At the same time, activist investors such as Elliott Management are pushing for higher returns and less spending on lower-return green projects. Understanding these tensions will help us frame hypotheses about how BP's strategy is viewed across different stakeholder groups.

We will convene a kick-off workshop with the BP team to serve three purposes:

1. Hypothesis Development: Discuss the brief in detail, develop a shared understanding of BP's current positioning, and explore hypotheses from existing research and those proposed by BP. We will consider how different stakeholder groups-including investors, regulators, NGOs, and communities-may perceive BP's evolving strategy.

2. Approach Sign-Off: Review and agree on the research approach, including recruitment strategy, terminology for media analysis, and project timing.

3. Ways of Working: Establish clear coordination, cadence, and communication formats for the project.

The output will be a document summarizing key hypotheses to be tested, areas needing further exploration, and a comprehensive project plan. This ensures alignment on research priorities and provides a focused foundation for the subsequent analysis phases.

### Phase Two: Traditional and Social Media Analysis

A blend of asking and listening remains critical to understanding how key stakeholders engage with BP's external landscape and to benchmarking BP's influence within it.

Before moving to qualitative research, we will conduct a thorough analysis of both traditional and social media. This will help us identify which individuals and organizations most actively engage with BP's stakeholders, uncover the main drivers of coverage, and benchmark BP's influence in the markets and sectors that matter most. The analysis will also provide context and insights to measure BP's influence over time and inform the selection of stakeholders for qualitative interviews.

Recent media and advocacy narratives are dominated by several themes. In 2023, BP produced 99 times more energy from oil and gas than from renewables, according to Reclaim Finance. NGOs and climate advocacy groups have intensified criticism, accusing BP of greenwashing and backtracking after cutting $5 billion from its low-carbon budget while investing over $10 billion in new oil and gas projects. BP's brand perception in clean energy has suffered as a result, with public sentiment and media coverage frequently labeling BP's actions as greenwashing. A 2024 Oil Change International report found BP, along with other oil majors, as not aligned with a 1.5Â°C pathway, rating BP 'insufficient' or 'grossly insufficient' on nearly all metrics. Public trust is low: only 14% of US voters trust oil and gas companies, including BP, to tell the truth about climate impacts, while over 60% have little or no trust.

Traditional media outlets such as Reuters, The Guardian, and Financial Times, as well as social media influencers like Greta Thunberg and Greenpeace, play a major role in shaping BP's public narrative. Overall sentiment in these channels leans negative or critical.

We use the following attributes to define "influence":

- Authority/Reach: Credibility and audience size in target markets and sectors.

- Connection: Degree of linkage to other influential voices in the climate and energy transition dialogue.

- Relevance: Frequency and pertinence of commentary on energy transition topics.

- Resonance: Audience engagement, including mentions, shares, and responses that indicate impact.

Our research will leverage advanced analytics platforms using natural language processing to uncover trends, themes, and sentiment across both traditional publications and social media channels such as X and Reddit. Insights from this phase will guide the identification of potential stakeholders for qualitative interviews and help shape strategic discussion guides. The media analysis will also highlight possible white space in the media landscape where BP can engage in more impactful ways.

### Phase Three: Elite Qualitative Research

After the traditional and social media analysis, we will have a clear baseline of BP's reputation and the topics, individuals, and organizations driving the energy transition debate. However, quantitative data alone cannot explain the motivations, priorities, or concerns of BP's most influential stakeholders. We recommend targeted qualitative research to probe deeper into how key audiences interpret BP's evolving strategy, the credibility of its "Beyond Petroleum" commitments, and the perceived strengths and weaknesses of its brand in clean energy versus traditional oil and gas.

#### In-Depth Interviews

We propose conducting up to 20 in-depth interviews with carefully selected senior stakeholders, segmented as follows:

  - Institutional investors (including both ESG-focused and activist shareholders)
  - Government and regulatory officials in the UK, EU, and North America
  - Senior NGO partners and climate advocacy leaders
  - Policy-makers and industry experts in clean energy and economic development

This mix will ensure we capture the full spectrum of expectations and pressures, from ESG investors demanding stronger climate action to activist shareholders seeking higher returns and less spending on low-return green projects. We will work with BP to refine the list, ensuring all participants are relevant to BP's global footprint and transition ambitions.

#### Recruitment

BP's global network and established relationships will be central to recruitment. Brunswick will support outreach by leveraging our own connections in public affairs, clean energy, and non-profit sectors. For sensitive audiences, initial invitations should come from BP to reinforce the research's importance and reassure participants of its strategic value. We will draft tailored communications for each stakeholder type, emphasizing the relevance of the research to their interests and BP's commitment to transparency.

Where appropriate, we will offer an incentive-such as a donation to a charity chosen by the respondent-to encourage participation. All interviews will be scheduled at the convenience of participants and conducted virtually to maximize accessibility across regions.

#### Focus Groups

To complement the interviews, we will run two virtual focus groups:

  - UK/EU policy influencers with expertise in decarbonization, climate regulation, and energy transition policy
  - US policy influencers with a focus on transatlantic energy policy, regulatory trends, and clean energy investment

Each group will include 6-8 participants, moderated by Brunswick, and will probe perceptions of BP's credibility, regulatory pressures (such as the North Sea Transition Deal and EU Green Deal), and the effectiveness of BP's engagement with policy-makers and NGOs.

#### Interview Approach

Discussion guides will be developed in partnership with BP, but will center on:

  - Stakeholder objectives and alignment with BP's net-zero and renewables targets
  - Awareness and understanding of BP's "Beyond Petroleum" strategy and recent shifts
  - Perceived credibility of BP's transition commitments, including the impact of recent rollbacks and brand association
  - Investor and regulatory pressures, including divided expectations between ESG and activist investors, and the influence of UK/EU decarbonization mandates
  - The role of NGOs and policy influencers in shaping BP's reputation and social license
  - Preferred information channels and trusted sources for updates on BP's progress

This qualitative phase will provide context and nuance to the quantitative findings, clarifying how BP's actions are interpreted by those with the greatest influence over its license to operate and grow in the energy transition.

#### In-Depth Interviews

For this phase, we recommend conducting up to 20 in-depth interviews with senior stakeholders across four groups:

  - Current and potential institutional investors, including both ESG-focused funds and activist investors seeking higher returns.
  - Government regulators and policy-makers in the UK, EU, and US, reflecting the increasing regulatory pressure from initiatives like the North Sea Transition Deal and EU Green Deal.
  - Senior leaders from NGOs and advocacy groups focused on economic development, climate policy, and clean energy.
  - Corporate partners engaged in joint renewables, hydrogen, and infrastructure projects.

These interviews will target individuals who shape or influence perceptions of BP's energy transition. We will prioritize participants with direct knowledge of BP's recent strategy shifts, such as the scaling back of renewables targets and changes in investment priorities. 

Our approach will ensure a balanced cross-section of perspectives from Europe, North America, and Asia, in line with BP's global footprint and the geographic spread of its key stakeholders. We will work with your team to refine the list and secure participation from those whose views most impact BP's brand and credibility in clean energy.

The findings will provide candid, evidence-based insights into:

  - How BP's transition is viewed by those who matter most to its future.
  - The expectations and concerns of investors, regulators, NGOs, and partners regarding BP's low-carbon commitments and delivery.
  - The credibility gap-if any-between BP's stated ambitions and stakeholders' perceptions.

These qualitative insights will underpin our recommendations for targeted engagement and communications strategies.

#### Recruitment

We recognize that BP's transition is under close scrutiny from a diverse group of stakeholders-investors, regulators, NGOs, and communities. Recruitment for qualitative interviews and focus groups must reflect this landscape and deliver credible, actionable insights.

We will work in close partnership with BP to identify and invite a balanced mix of current and potential stakeholders. This will include institutional investors, government regulators, NGO partners in clean energy, and representatives from communities affected by BP's projects. We will leverage Brunswick's global network and BP's established relationships to ensure a representative cross-section, with particular attention to those who influence BP's reputation and license to operate.

Initial outreach should come from BP. This signals the importance of the research and reassures participants of its relevance. We will draft tailored invitations for each stakeholder group, highlighting the research's objectives and the value of their participation. Customization will be key-messages will reflect each group's priorities, such as net-zero targets for investors, regulatory compliance for policymakers, or local impact for community leaders.

Brunswick will follow up with scheduling support, using both email and phone as appropriate. For certain audiences, we will offer an incentive-such as a donation to a charity chosen by the respondent from an approved list-to encourage participation and demonstrate BP's commitment to community benefit.

For focus groups, we will recruit senior policy professionals and NGO leaders with experience in clean energy, economic mobility, and policy in Europe, Asia, and North America. Each group will consist of 6-8 participants and be moderated by an experienced Brunswick facilitator. This approach ensures robust, candid discussion and delivers the qualitative depth needed for BP's Influence & Engagement Assessment.

#### Focus Groups

Brunswick's relationships with research partners enable us to identify and recruit high-level policy professionals who are familiar with clean energy, economic mobility, and policy discussions. For this project, we will convene two virtual focus groups: one with UK Policy Influencers and one with US Policy Influencers. Participants will be selected for their expertise in African and South Asian geopolitics, experience in developmental assistance, and familiarity with energy transition issues relevant to BP's operations.

Each 90-minute group will consist of 6-8 participants and be led by a Brunswick professional moderator. This approach ensures candid discussion among individuals who influence regulatory and public expectations for BP, particularly as UK and EU regulators increase pressure on decarbonization through frameworks like the North Sea Transition Deal and EU Green Deal. We will also probe how investor pressures-ranging from ESG-focused demands for stronger climate action to activist calls for higher returns-shape perceptions of BP's credibility and strategy.

Insights from these sessions will inform our understanding of stakeholder sentiment and help benchmark BP's brand-association strength in clean energy against its peers.

#### Interview Approach

For both in-depth interviews and focus groups, we will work closely with BP to develop a discussion guide tailored to the company's current context and stakeholder landscape. The guide will draw on established best practices for executive-level qualitative research and will be structured as follows:

- Top Objectives
  
  - Identify stakeholders' primary goals and priorities.
  
  - Assess alignment between these objectives and BP's evolving mission, including its shift toward renewables.

- Understanding of BP's Transition
  
  - Gauge awareness of BP's "Beyond Petroleum" commitments and recent changes in strategy.
  
  - Surface misconceptions or knowledge gaps regarding BP's decarbonization efforts and investment mix.

- Perceived Impact on Stakeholders
  
  - Explore how BP's actions have affected stakeholder success, with attention to both traditional energy and low-carbon initiatives.
  
  - Identify which programs or investments resonate most, including recent projects in renewables and community investment.

- BP Brand Association in Clean Energy
  
  - Probe perceptions of BP's credibility in the energy transition, especially relative to peers such as Shell and TotalEnergies.
  
  - Discuss the impact of recent strategic shifts and media narratives around greenwashing.

- Investor and Regulatory Pressures
  
  - Examine how divided investor expectations (e.g., ESG-focused vs. activist investors) shape perceptions of BP's strategy.
  
  - Consider the influence of regulatory developments in key markets (UK, EU, US).

- Influential Figures and Channels
  
  - Identify key influencers and trusted information sources in the energy and climate space.
  
  - Assess which traditional and social media channels most affect stakeholder perceptions of BP.

- Media Preferences and Trust
  
  - Determine preferred media platforms for energy and sustainability news.
  
  - Explore levels of trust in BP's communications, noting that recent US survey data show only 14% of voters trust oil and gas companies to tell the truth about climate impacts.

This approach ensures that interviews yield candid, evidence-based insights into how BP is seen by its most critical stakeholders, and where targeted engagement can most effectively strengthen credibility in renewables and community investment.

### Phase Four: Analysis

Our analysis will be systematic, robust, and grounded in evidence. We treat analysis as an ongoing, iterative process. As research progresses, we will organize interim findings and test emerging hypotheses, maximizing value from each phase.

The team will work collaboratively, drawing on both core Brunswick expertise and sector specialists. We will contextualize findings with input from BP stakeholders and share interim themes for discussion and validation.

We will root our analysis in the voices of participants, using qualitative recordings and transcripts rather than assumptions. This ensures our conclusions reflect stakeholder realities, not preconceived narratives.

The analysis will focus on:

- Mapping how BP's energy transition is perceived by key stakeholders-investors, regulators, NGOs, and local communities-using both qualitative and quantitative data.

- Benchmarking BP's brand association and credibility in renewables against peers such as Shell, TotalEnergies, and Equinor. Notably, BP is often viewed as less consistent on renewables, and all majors are criticized for falling short of the 1.5Â°C pathway.

- Assessing the impact of recent strategic shifts, including the reduction of BP's 2030 oil and gas production cut target from 40% to 25%, the scrapping of the 50 GW renewables target, and investment patterns-$1.3 billion spent on low-carbon business versus $15 billion on oil and gas in 2023.

- Evaluating progress and credibility: BP's renewables pipeline has grown to 60.6 GW, with full ownership of Lightsource BP and a new 50:50 JV with JERA (13 GW offshore wind). Yet, in 2023, BP produced 99 times more energy from oil and gas than renewables. This gap is central to stakeholder skepticism and accusations of greenwashing.

- Analyzing reputational and regulatory risks: NGOs and climate advocates have intensified criticism following cuts to the low-carbon budget. Public trust remains low, with only 14% of US voters trusting oil and gas firms on climate. Investor pressures are divided, with some demanding stronger climate action and others pushing for higher returns.

- Identifying positive community impacts and transition efforts: BP's renewables projects, such as the Peacock Solar Farm, have created jobs and tax revenue. Skills retraining programs in Aberdeen and Teesside support a just transition. These examples are important for demonstrating local value.

- Reviewing transparency and disclosure: BP publishes annual TCFD-aligned reports and Net Zero Progress Updates, but some investors seek more detail on net-zero alignment and scenario planning.

We will draw together these findings to deliver actionable insights on BP's current position, stakeholder perceptions, and the credibility of its energy transition narrative. The analysis will inform targeted engagement strategies and recommendations to strengthen BP's standing with critical audiences.

### Phase Five: Reporting and Next Steps

We will deliver three core outputs, each tailored to BP's objectives and stakeholder landscape:

- Research design memo: A Word document summarizing key insights from the hypothesis generation phase. It will guide research materials and clarify which hypotheses and stakeholder concerns merit focus.

- Media analysis: A PowerPoint report capturing findings from traditional and social media. This will map the online conversation at the intersection of clean energy and economic mobility, highlight influential channels, and benchmark BP's brand association against peers.

- Full report: A PowerPoint presentation consolidating all research findings. This will include:
  
  - Comparative insights across stakeholder groups (investors, regulators, NGOs, communities)
  - Brand-association metrics and peer benchmarking
  - Recommendations for targeted engagement, including:
    
    - Reaffirming credible transition targets and publishing an annual Renewables Progress Report with third-party verification
    - Enhancing ESG investor engagement and transparency
    - Launching media campaigns focused on success stories (e.g., Peacock Solar Farm's local tax revenue and emissions reductions)
    - Collaborating with NGOs, forming a BP Climate Advisory Council, and piloting community investment programs
    - Leveraging social media influencers to amplify positive narratives
    - Integrating community co-benefits-such as jobs, tax revenue, and retraining programs-into project rollouts

BP's ability to deliver shared benefits will be a central theme, as it directly influences social license and acceptance of future projects.
